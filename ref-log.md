This project was engaging and much more intuitive for me compared to Assignment 1. Because the process was more streamlined, I was able to focus on understanding the agents’ reasoning rather than getting bogged down in implementation details. Ironically, the hardest part of this was dealing with GitHub!

I especially appreciated being able to trace the Planner and Reviewer agents’ logic: the app clearly displayed the initial itinerary, the Reviewer’s verification process, and the resulting delta list of proposed changes. Having access to both the original and revised plans made it easier to interpret how the two agents collaborated.

I initially tested the app with European destinations but realized I didn’t know enough about those regions to evaluate accuracy, so I shifted to a more familiar location: my hometown, Bethesda, Maryland. Interestingly, the app included two of my favorite restaurants, but the itinerary itself felt somewhat uninspired. I assumed this was because there isn’t much to do in Bethesda beyond dining, but it also highlighted a limitation of strictly pragmatic planning. For instance, the itinerary suggested visiting the NIH, which is technically located in Bethesda, but not open for casual tourism.

When I compared results with ChatGPT, its itinerary felt more creative and relaxed, but also less feasible. This contrast helped me appreciate the balance my app achieved between realism and variety. The Planner and Reviewer’s clearly defined roles seemed to minimize factual errors but also constrained imaginative possibilities. When I explicitly asked for an “exciting” day in Bethesda, the output became much more dynamic and experimental, and the Reviewer’s delta list expanded accordingly. I briefly considered modifying the Planner’s prompt to encourage more lively suggestions but decided that the prompt design itself determines the itinerary’s tone, so users can decide what type of trip they want to take themselves.

I used co-pilot to help generate my code and prompts for the agents, and I used ChatGPT both to evaluate/compare responses to my app, and to edit my reflection for grammar/wording.
